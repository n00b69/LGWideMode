# LGWideMode
Tasker project + app for using Wide Mode in any app

## Why does this repository exist?
The original app is no longee available on the Google Play Store, and the original Tasker project had several issues and annoyances that I wanted to fix.

### Installation guide
- Install the .xapk from the releases using any XAPK installer.
- Download [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm) and import the project .xml by long pressing on the home icon.
- Enable the following permissions in Tasker to properly use the project:
* Write secure settings
* Draw over other apps
* Accessibility settings

> [!Note]
> You might need root access, but maybe not

### Known bugs and annoyances
- It may take a few minutes before Wide Mode can properly be toggled when booting up your device. Have patience and don't press the assistant button a million times.
